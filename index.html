    <p>At Cuckoos we're a local community made up of</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Singers</li>
      <li>Dancers</li>
      <li>Actors</li>
      <li>Volunteers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cuckoos is currently focusing on two different projects.</p>
    <p>
      One being run by all the members under the age of eighteen. While the
      other being run by all the over eighteens.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two projects are rather diverse and are nothing like eachother. This
      allows the younger members of Cuckoos to really express and perform what
      matters to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The over eighteens have been eager to put on a more
      <em>risque</em> show for a long time and this allows us to finally
      do that. We are putting on a show called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noises_Off">Noises Off.</a> A sex
      farce!
    </p>

    <p>
      While the younger generation are bringing you their very own cabaret
      called
      <a
